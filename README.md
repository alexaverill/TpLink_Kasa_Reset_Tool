# Tp Kasa Smart light reset tool
Manually trying to reset the TP link Kasa smart bulbs is a pain, it requires fairly specific timing and has caused me immense frustration. So I wrote a script to fix it.
This is running on a Raspberry Pi Pico which controls a relay that is wired into a 120V light socket.
